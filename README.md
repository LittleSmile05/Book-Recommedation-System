# ðŸ“š Bookaroo: Personalized Book Recommendation System

A content-based and collaborative filtering model that recommends top books to users, allowing them to discover their next great read. The frontend is built with a dynamic UI to showcase the top books and manage user favorites.

## âœ¨ Features

* **Hybrid Recommendation Model:** Utilizes a combination of **Content-Based Filtering** (using book metadata) and **Collaborative Filtering** (using user ratings and similarity) to provide accurate and diverse recommendations.
* **Top 50 Display:** Showcases the top 50 highly rated and most popular books on the landing page.
* **Dynamic Favorites List:** Users can "like" books, which are stored in a session-based list and viewable in a dedicated modal.
* **Paginated Loading:** Uses a "Load More" feature on the frontend to improve performance and user experience by loading books in batches.
* **Interactive UI:** Modern and responsive design built with HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript.

cp -r ./* $REPO_DIR/
cp -r ./.??* $REPO_DIR/ 2>/dev/null  # For hidden files like .gitignore, ignoring errors if none exist

# 4. Navigate into the repository directory
cd $REPO_DIR

# 5. Stage all changes (new, modified, and deleted files)
echo "Adding and staging all changes..."
git add .
